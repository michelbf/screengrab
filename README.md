Simple script to visit URLs and take a screenshot, saving it to a word document.

Very first draft


_Usage:  usage: screengrab.py [-h] [--headless] [-c <chromedriver_path>] file_

_[--headless]   -   Optional. Runs Chrome Driver in background._

_file           -   Specify file where addresses are._

_IMPORTANT: If you don't provide the -c argument. ChromeDriver needs to be downloaded to your machine and in your PATH._
